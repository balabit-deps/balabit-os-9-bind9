bind9 (1:9.18.0-2ubuntu1) jammy; urgency=medium

  Support for DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) were included in
  bind 9.17. This package is built with support for both.

  The /etc/bind/db.root configuration file has not been shipped in the
  specified path by recent bind versions, but was available in bionic. Unless
  there are local changes to this file, it will be removed upon package
  upgrade (if present).

  The binary files which are neither daemons nor administrative programs have
  been moved from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin. They are:
  dnssec-cds, dnssec-dsfromkey, dnssec-keyfromlabel, dnssec-keygen,
  dnssec-revoke, dnssec-settime, dnssec-signzone, dnssec-verify,
  named-checkconf, named-checkzone, named-compilezone, dnssec-importkey,
  named-journalprint, named-nzd2nzf, and nsec3hash.

  Support for the map zone file format has been removed since bind 9.17. Users
  relying on such zone file format should convert their zones to use the raw
  format and change configurations accordingly before upgrading bind.

  Several obsolete, non-working configuration options have been removed and
  are now treated as configuration failures when present. They are:
  acache-cleaning-interval, acache-enable, additional-from-auth,
  additional-from-cache, allow-v6-synthesis, cleaning-interval, dnssec-enable,
  dnssec-lookaside, filter-aaaa, filter-aaaa-on-v4, filter-aaaa-on-v6,
  geoip-use-ecs, lwres, max-acache-size, nosit-udp-size, queryport-pool-ports,
  queryport-pool-updateinterval, request-sit, sit-secret, support-ixfr,
  use-queryport-pool, and use-ixfr.

bind9 (1:9.16.0-1ubuntu1) focal; urgency=medium

  Some packages like isc-dhcp do not build with bind 9.14 or higher, so a new
  source package bind9-libs version 9.11 was created for that purpose,
  providing only libraries and header files. The bind9 9.16.x packages do not
  provide development libraries or headers. See commit
  https://salsa.debian.org/dns-team/bind9-libs/commit/40cab7029d for more
  details. udebs used in the debian-installer are also being provided by
  bind9-libs.

  Another package which doesn't build with the newer bind9 package is
  bind-dyndb-ldap. It will build using the libraries from bind9-libs, but
  since this is a server plugin, it won't work with the newer server.

  Native pkcs#11 support via softhsm2 is no longer being built for this
  package. This was first introduced in 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-8 (see
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1565392) for FreeIPA. Ubuntu Focal no longer
  ships FreeIPA, and Debian also dropped the native pkcs#11 support.

  There are no development libraries or header files in this bind9 9.16.x
  packaging at the moment. This may change later, see
  https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/merge_requests/3089#note_111229
